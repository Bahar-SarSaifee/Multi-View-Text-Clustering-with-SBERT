# Multi-View-Text-Clustering-with-SBERT

This notebook uses Unsupervised Learning to cluster the texts from the "BBC News" dataset.
I use the KMeans algorithm to group the vectors generated by the TF-IDF. Then I use Principal Component Analysis to visualize groups.

- **First step:**
  Text representation with pre-trained encoders from Sentence-BERT
- **Second step:**
  Clustering Views with the k-means clustering algorithm
- **Third step:**
  Aggregation Partitions with selective voting technique
